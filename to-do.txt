0. Create the separate sections for the inputs and the btns
1. Create the section for "remove btn" and "up and down arrows"
2. Attach locations and times sections to a sub section for the gca div (there will be second section with the remove button and up and down arrows)
3. Create a custom made import field that can be used for #2 but also for things like the key removal time and even in other programs for HWMV. Make it universal
4. Figure out how the custom made input fields work (through a mix of classes and javascript programming)
