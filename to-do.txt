1. Use JavaScript for current time function
2. In the "time-input popup" clicking on minutes (or seconds if avaliable) should make the fill the time. You shouldn't need to press a key. Get JavaScript to do this.
3. Create a custom made input field that can be used for #2 but also for things like the key removal time and even in other programs for HWMV. Make it universal
4. Figure out how the custom made input fields work (through a mix of classes and javascript programming)
5. When doing GCA inputs, the default hour "value" of the time should update, for all the below times, if an hour is changed. For example inputting "15:29" would make all of the following times get "15" for the hour (unless changed)
6. Add a button to just input the current time (like a checkmark)
7. Button to add seconds to time
8. Military time in time select
